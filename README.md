# Book-Collection-Frontend

<!-- Add (Create):

Functionality: This allows the user to add a new book to the collection.
Implementation: You would typically have a form where the user can enter details such as the title, author, genre, and year published. When the form is submitted, the data is sent to the server, and the server adds this new book to the database.
View (Read):

Functionality: This allows the user to view the list of books in the collection.
Implementation: This typically involves fetching the list of books from the server and displaying them on the web page. Each book's details (title, author, genre, and year published) are shown in a readable format, often in a list or grid layout.
Edit (Update):

Functionality: This allows the user to update the details of an existing book.
Implementation: When the user wants to edit a book, the application pre-fills the form with the current details of the book. The user can then change any of the details and submit the form. The updated data is sent to the server, which updates the book's details in the database.
Delete (Delete):

Functionality: This allows the user to remove a book from the collection.
Implementation: The user can select a book to delete, often by clicking a delete button next to the bookâ€™s details. This action sends a request to the server to delete the book from the database. -->
